AJAX
--> Asynchronus JavaScript And Xml
--> Synchronous Request-Response
	- Browser Places a call to the server(Request) and it waits to recieve the response from the server.
	- During the wait period, the browser window freezes
--> Asynchronous Request-Response
	- Browser places a call on another object on the client side.
	- This Object is called XmlHttpRequest (XHR) object, part of browser
	- The XHR object, in turn, will place the call on the server.
	- The browser call completes, and the browser is now free
	- the XHR Object waits for the response from the server
	- Once it recieves the complete Response, the XHR object will call or execute a script on the client, this script
is called as "Callback functon"
	- A callback function is asssigned to the XHR object
	- This function typically updates a part of the page.

XHR concept was introduced by Microsoft back in 1998/99 with Outlook Web Access.(discontinued becoz there is no privacy of data since application runs in background continuesly)
(Google picked up it in 2004 and made secure)

--JavaScript

---> JS is used for placing the calls, updating the page,
---> all scripting for asynch operation are done using JS

--XML
---> Was the original data transfer format,
---> Instead of XML, use JSON or plain text


$.ajax({options}); => create the XMLHttpRequest, and other operations
$.get({})
$.post({})
$.getJson({})

//Handle JS Events like onClick.
