Constructor

--Initializer or special method which is invoked immidiately after creating the object
--Initialize the fields, to a different value apart from the default value.
--constructer can be overloaded with multiple parameters
--usually do not return any value and carry the class name
--constructors can be declared as private, protected, internal, public, or static
--a private ctor is used to restrict the object creation from outside the class
	(singleton Design pattern -> Only one object should ever exist for a class)
--a static ctor is executed just before the first static method is called or just before the first object for the class is  created. used to initialize static variable


Factory Method -- function which accepts inputs and generates an output object if the desired specification are met, else 			return null.
