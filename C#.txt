C#
brand new language, created specifically for .NET
simplicity of C++, OO concept of java
standardize as ECMA spec
MS implementation is called visual C#
truly oo language
case sensitive


casing Convetion in .net

1.PascalCasing - first letter of each word is capitalized.
		-used for Namespace, class, delegates, interfaces, properties, events, methods, structs, enums
2.camelCasing - first letter of first word is lower cased, subsequently capitalized
		-used for variables and parameters
3._variables - private fields of a class
4.FULL_CAPS - Full capitalization was used for constants
5.all lowercase - reserved words in C#


--datatypes in c# [int,short,long,uint,ushort,ulong,byte,sbyte,char,bool,string,object, decimal, float, double]
--variables
[modifiers]<datatypes><identifiers> [=<initial_value>]
modifiers -> public, private, protected, internal, protected internal, static, reaadonly,const,volatile,
data type -> any valid .net type
identifiers -> name of variables,should not be a reserved word, 
should begin with underscore|letters, can be 256 chars long

--all variables should be initialized before usage - compiler throws an error otherwise.


I/O statements
console.writeLine -> prints a sequence of chars followed by /n	--puts()
console.Write -> prints a sequence of chars.			--printf()
Console.ReadLine ->reads a sequence of chars terminated by /n	--gets()
Console.Read ->reads ASCII value of the char			--......
Console.ReadKey ->acknowledges a key press.			--getch()

Escape Sequences
 \n, \t, \b, \\, \f, \r, \a, \"


formatting of outputs
("{0}",1990) --> interpolation
("{0:N}",1990) --> interpolation //formats as number
("{0:C}",1990) --> interpolation //format as currency if ("{0:C2}",1990) for 2 decimal places


namespaces
--logical organization of related types
--ease of use, better understanding, reusabality of type-names
--resolves type-name conflicts
--every type has FQN -> fuly qualified name of the type
--use the namespace keyword to define a namespace
--should contain at least one type, and can contain child namespaces
--eg: Company.Application.Project.SubProject.
--eg: Microdoft.Office.Word
